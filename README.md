GreenwayPlaces is a game that tests your knowledge of US east coast cities.

To start the game, just click the "Go" button. From time to time, you will see the name of a city appear at the top right of the screen in green. When that happens, go over to the map and click on the location you think that city is located. If you are close, you will be awarded points based on how close you are to the actual location and the time it took you to click.

GreenwayPlaces is a WPF application written in C#. It runs in Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows Desktop.
